The new model of integrating technology into the curriculum means that computers are on demand throughout the school day. Technology teachers and administrators face the task of developing a technology plan that makes the most effective and efficient use of the computer hardware available to them. Whether using desktops or laptops, Macs or PCs, the computer lab remains the center for most computing activity in schools. Our computer labs provide well equipped computers with hardware and softwares.  </p>
